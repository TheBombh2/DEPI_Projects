# Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative Projects

During my 2nd and 3rd years of Computer Science college, I joined the first round of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**. This program offered comprehensive training in **technical skills**, **freelancing**, and **English proficiency**.

I chose to specialize in the **Mobile Application Development** track. This repository will showcase every project I completed, whether for submission to instructors or to feature in my portfolio.
